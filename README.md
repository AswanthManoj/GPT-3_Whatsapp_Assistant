# GPT-3_Whatsapp_Assistant

This code uses the Cohere and OpenAI GPT-3 language model APIs, as well as the UltraMsg WhatsApp API, to bring language model functionality to WhatsApp chats. It also makes use of the Langchain library, which enhances language models with additional features such as web searching.

To elaborate further on the functionality of this code, the chat assistant is able to classify incoming messages into one of several categories, such as "logical", "emotional", "mathematical", etc. This is done using the Cohere language model API, which is trained to classify texts into these categories based on a series of prompts that are provided as input.

In addition to classification, the chat assistant is also able to generate responses to messages using language models. This is done using the OpenAI GPT-3 API, which is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text. The chat assistant uses GPT-3 to generate responses to user messages, allowing for more natural and conversational interactions.

The chat assistant also has the ability to perform web searches and return results to the user. This is done using the Langchain library, which enhances language models with additional features such as web searching. The chat assistant is able to search the web for information on a wide range of topics and return the results to the user in a clear and concise manner.

Finally, the chat assistant is able to analyze the sentiment of messages and classify them into different emotions, such as "happiness", "sadness", "anger", etc. This is done using the Langchain library, which provides tools for analyzing the sentiment of texts. By analyzing the sentiment of incoming messages, the chat assistant is able to provide a more personalized and empathetic response to users.

Overall, this code provides a powerful and flexible tool for bringing language model functionality to WhatsApp chats, allowing for more natural and engaging interactions with users.
